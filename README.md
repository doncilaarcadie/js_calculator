# JS Calculator

A simple, fully functional calculator web application built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was created a few years ago as part of an in-class assignment during my Software Engineering degree. The main constraint of the task was not to use any external libraries or frameworks — everything had to be implemented from scratch using only core web technologies.

Beyond functionality, a strong emphasis was placed on visual design, making this primarily a CSS styling challenge as well as a JavaScript logic exercise.
